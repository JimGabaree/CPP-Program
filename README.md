	This project was created in order for a company to display dual time clocks. One clock would show standard 12-hour time, and the second would simultaneously display the same time but in 24-hour format. The program also allows the user to change the time and displays a clean user-friendly menu with instructions on how to update the time. Even though the project is fairly simple I feel I kept it clean and concise. The program was also documented in a manner as to display to anyone reviewing the program to how it is intended to operate. Again, the code is fairly simple and did not pose much of a challenge. It did however display the basic understanding of C++ syntax as well and aided in testing the functionality of my IDE and compiler. I find that by creating this project it gave me a great foundation on the C++ language and taught me the basic syntax of C++. It also helped me overcome many issues my peers and I faced when working with an outdated IDE. I kept the program fairly simple so a basic programmer or an individual learning C++ could easily read along with the comments and see how the code operates.
